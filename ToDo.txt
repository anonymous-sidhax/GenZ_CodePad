ToDo Backend:
  [ ] from word2number import w2n in requirements.txt
  [ ] Combine delete(), delete_all(), delete_line() in one i.e. delete(). Kepp if else logic inside delete().
  [ ] Use tuple to analyze() - I really think a dict would be counterproductive for this, I’d go for keywords = ((“delete all”, delete_all), (“delete line”, delete_line), …)
  And check if speech.startswith(keyword).
  [ ] Snore, Wake Up Command.
  [ ] Multiple words phrase hello there (all lowercase), sentence hello there (capitalizes first)
  [ ] word something (types full word in lowercase)
  [ ] Basic editing slap (newline), scratch (backspace), act (escape), slap three, etc
  [ ] act colon single-quote double-quote equal space tab bang hash dollar percent carrot ampersand star late rate minus underscore plus backslash dot slash question
  [ ] read new file : with open('', 'r') as f: data = f.read()
  [ ] .strip() . split()    (Split New Line) = split("\n")
  [ ] go right, up, left, down
  [ ] for loop, while loop
  [ ] beginning or end of line - meg stands for "move to beginning", mel stands for "move end of line"
  [ ] Moving the cursor left and right across word boundaries - law and raw stand for "left a word", "right a word"
  [ ] Enable Python/Java/C

ToDo Frontend:
  [ ] Move all fonts to static/fonts folder.
  [ ] Create base.html with navbar and footer.
  [ ] Auto Refresh only textarea based on speech (Ajax/JS)
